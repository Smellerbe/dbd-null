dbd-null
========

This is a very primitive database driver for [libdbi][1], that does
pretty much nothing. It does just enough to make [syslog-ng][2] work
with it without throwing errors all over the place.

That's all there is to it, nothing more, nothing less, and it will
very likely stay that way.
